### Here I first use [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) to [deal with images](https://github.com/devanomaly/basic-video-stuff-with-python/blob/main/initial-tinkering/first-steps-with-openCV.ipynb). 
### Next, simple face detection in images is done. You can find it in [this notebook](https://github.com/devanomaly/basic-video-stuff-with-python/blob/main/initial-tinkering/detect-faces-in-images.ipynb).
### Then, I show how to do realtime video capture of the user's webcam and I also do realtime frontal face detection with aforementioned webcam's footage. That's [here](https://github.com/devanomaly/basic-video-stuff-with-python/blob/main/initial-tinkering/video-capture.ipynb).
### As a final project, we have a motion detector app that records timestamps of motion.
