# basic-video-stuff-with-python
### Here I first use [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) to deal with images. 
### Then, I show how to do realtime video capture of the user's webcam; 
### I also do realtime frontal face detection with aforementioned webcam's footage. 
### As a final project, we have a motion detector app that records timestapms of motion.
